# Twilio Dev Phone Configuration

## Setup Rules
1. Dev Phone is a standalone tool and should be started separately from the main application
2. Default port is 3001 (do not change)
3. Access at `http://localhost:3001` after starting

## Starting Dev Phone
```bash
# Start in a separate terminal
twilio dev-phone
```

## Important Notes
1. Dev Phone maintains its own state and connection
2. No need to restart when restarting other services
3. Keep running in a dedicated terminal window
4. Uses its own Twilio credentials from `twilio login`

## Common Issues
1. If port 3001 is in use:
   - Use cleanup script first
   - Check for other processes: `lsof -i :3001`
   - Kill manually if needed: `kill -9 $(lsof -ti :3001)`

2. If authentication fails:
   - Run `twilio login` again
   - Verify credentials with `twilio profiles:list`

## Security Notes
- Dev Phone uses local credentials from Twilio CLI
- Does not share environment variables with main application
